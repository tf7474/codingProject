1.Implement (from scratch, without using Java library components) a doubly linked list (of
integers) class which allows new integers to be added to either end of the list, any referenced
node to be removed, and the first and last integers to be read quickly.

2. Write a Java function which, when passed a string containing a mixture of bracket characters -
i.e. ‘{‘, ‘}’, ‘[‘, ‘]’, ‘(‘ and ‘)’, returns true if the brackets in the string are correctly balanced, and
false otherwise. E.g. when called with “{[(())]()}” it should return true, but “{[(()])()}” should
return false. Non-bracket characters in the string should be ignored.
