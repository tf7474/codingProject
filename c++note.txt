1. Implement a class with a member function 'int nobjs()' which returns the number of object
of that class currently in existence. What assumptions have you made?

2. Given:
struct node_t
{
    unsigned v;
    struct node_t* next;
};

A singly linked list of nodes is referred to by a pointer to the head node (the head pointer will be
NULL in the case of an empty list).

Write a function:
struct node_t* even_nodes(struct node_t**)

which is passed a pointer to the head pointer of a list. It should remove all n
